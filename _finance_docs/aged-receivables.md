# Aged Receivables Reports

Freedom Church and Wildfire may issue invoices for a number of reasons, including course fees, rent and room hire.

An aged receivables report is a record that shows unpaid invoice balances, along with the duration for which they've been outstanding at the report date. It also includes any overpayments and credit notes. Positive figures are shown in brackets.

Each month, the operations team sends statements to 'customers' and provides aged receivables reports to budget holders. Interim reports can be requested at any time by emailing <operations@freedomchurch.cc>.

**Monthly statements are a helpful reminder, but it's expected that budget holders will use aged receivables reports to follow up overdue invoices personally.**

Aged receivables reports are produced for relevant Freedom Church and Wildfire locations/departments, and include the following information for each outstanding invoice (or credit), grouped by customer:

- Invoice date
- Due date
- Invoice number
- Invoice reference
- Ageing period

Ageing periods include:

- Current - the invoice is unpaid but not overdue
- < 1 month - the invoice is less than one month overdue
- 1 month - the invoice is one full month overdue
- 2 month - the invoice is two full months overdue
- 3 month - the invoice is three full months overdue
- Older - the invoice is more than four months overdue

Amounts outstanding are summarised for each ageing period by customer and, on the final line, for the report as a whole.
