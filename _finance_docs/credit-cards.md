# Credit Cards

We issue credit cards to members of staff who regularly need to make purchases on behalf of Freedom Church or Wildfire. It is important to note that cards issued by one entity should not be used to make purchases for the other. Under certain circumstances we also issue credit cards to volunteers, for example location leaders who are not employees of Freedom Church. In most cases, each card has a Â£5,000/month credit limit.

**As a cardholder, you are responsible for the security of your card, all spending on it and the monthly submission of invoices or itemised receipts.**

At the beginning of each month, you will receive a link to a spreadsheet which lists your recent transactions. You will need to upload an invoice or itemised receipt (not a credit card slip) for every transaction to a specific Google Drive folder. Accepted file types are PDF, JPG and PNG. All transactions listed on the spreadsheet must be assigned a location and a department, and if relevant, a project. Additional information can be provided if an item's description is not obvious. This task must be completed by the end of the month.

**It is essential that we are able to demonstrate that our credit cards have only been used for legitimate spending. If you are unable to provide an invoice or itemised receipt, and it is not obvious from the card statement what the transaction relates to, we will ask you to reimburse Freedom Church or Wildfire.**

Please note that if invoices or receipts are still outstanding at the beginning of the next month, or reimbursement is still required for missing evidence or accidental personal purchases, credit cards will be temporarily suspended until those issues are resolved.

While not essential for the management of your card, you are able to access [ClearSpend](https://clearspend.natwest.com/login): NatWest's web and mobile app that lets cardholders view transactions and balances at any time. If you need help accessing ClearSpend, please contact the operations team.

You may set up [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) or [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) on your own mobile device, but under no circumstances should your card be added to someone else's device.

If your credit card is lost or stolen, please inform NatWest immediately on 0370 010 1152, and also notify the operations team.

Should you have any questions about specific transactions, your credit limit, or anything else to do with your credit card, please email <operations@freedomchurch.cc>.
