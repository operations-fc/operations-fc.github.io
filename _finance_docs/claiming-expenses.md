# Claiming Expenses

When making purchases on behalf of Freedom Church or Wildfire, we recommend that you:

1. request an invoice from the supplier that can be paid by bank transfer, or
2. use a credit card that has been issued by the operations team.

That said, we recognise that there may be times when using your own money is the only option, particularly if you are a volunteer.

To reclaim purchase expenses, you should submit a claim form, accompanied by itemised receipts (not credit/debit card slips or statements) for every transaction listed. Where expenses are incurred in another currency, the claim should either be for the GBP amount debited from your account or, where paid in cash, [converted at the rate applicable on that day](https://www.xe.com/currencytables/).

If you are required to travel, we will reimburse your reasonable expenses, but this does not include travel to and from your home and your usual place of work. If you use your own car, you may claim mileage allowance at the rate of 25p per mile. No reservation for overnight accommodation or air travel may be made without the express prior written consent of the budget holder.

**Warning:** Please note that expenses will only be reimbursed if they are approved by the budget holder after you have submitted your claim. You should therefore always seek permission before incurring any costs.

All claims must be submitted using one of the following forms:

- [Purchase expense claim](https://freedomchurchcc.formstack.com/forms/purchase_expense_claim)
- [Mileage expense claim](https://freedomchurchcc.formstack.com/forms/mileage_expense_claim)

In exceptional circumstances, expenses of less than Â£20 may be reimbursed from a campus cash account at the finance coordinator's discretion.

Claims for expenses should be submitted promptly, ideally no later than the end of the month following the month in which the expense was incurred. Please be aware that budget holders might not approve claims for expenses that are more than three months old.

We process expenses as quickly as we can, but payment may take up to two weeks depending on which day your claim is submitted and how quickly the budget holder approves it. You will receive a remittance notice via email once your payment has been scheduled.

If you have any questions about expenses, please email <finance@freedomchurch.cc> or <finance@wildfire.ltd>.
